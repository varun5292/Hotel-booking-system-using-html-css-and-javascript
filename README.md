Login Page: Users can securely log in to access their accounts or create new ones if they're new to the system. This page ensures that only authorized individuals can access the booking features.

Home Page: Upon logging in, users are greeted with a visually appealing home page that provides an overview of the Blue Berry hotel chain. It may include highlights of different properties, promotional offers, and quick access to booking options.

Amenities Page: This section showcases the amenities available at various Blue Berry hotels. Users can explore facilities such as swimming pools, fitness centers, spa services, restaurants, and more. Rich multimedia content like images and videos can be included to entice potential guests.

Branches of Hotels: Users can browse through the different branches of Blue Berry hotels, each with its unique charm and offerings. Information about the location, room types, rates, and special packages can be displayed to help users make informed decisions.

Food Menu: Guests can peruse the diverse culinary offerings available at Blue Berry hotels. This section can display menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner, as well as room service options. Users may also have the ability to customize their orders based on dietary preferences or restrictions.

Booking Page: The heart of the system, the booking page allows users to select their desired hotel branch, room type, check-in/out dates, and any additional preferences. Real-time availability updates ensure that users can make bookings with confidence.

Confirmation Page: After completing the booking process, users receive a confirmation page summarizing their reservation details. This includes the booking reference number, total cost, payment information, and any special instructions. Users can also opt to receive a confirmation email for their records.
